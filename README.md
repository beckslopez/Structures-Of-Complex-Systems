# Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the files from in class and homework assignments for my Spring 2022 AMATH 563 taught at the University of Washington by Eli Shlizerman. Please see below for the descripition of the course from our syllabus:

The course AMATH 563 Inferring Structure Of Complex Systems aims to provide an introduction, concepts, and fundamental skills for Data Analysis and Investigation of Complex systems with Machine and Deep Learning tools.
We will survey the fundamentals of data analysis and embeddings, machine learning, and introduce Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)  in detail as a generic computing framework. We will then build computational skills for training neural networks, understanding and working with algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam, Dropout, Initialization, etc, and different types of ANNs, such as Convolutional networks, RNNs. We will also cover sequential data processing such as embeddings and models data.
